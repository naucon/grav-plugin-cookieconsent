# Cookie Consent Plugin![Cookie Consent](assets/readme_1.png)The **Cookie Consent** Plugin is for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav). This grav plugin is to alert users about the use of cookies on your website. The plugin integrates the popular js lib [cookie consent](https://github.com/osano/cookieconsent) by Osano - previously known as Silktide Cookie Consent and Cookie Consent by Insites.## InstallationInstalling the Cookieconsent plugin can be done in one of two ways. The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the plugin with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file.### GPM Installation (Preferred)The simplest way to install this plugin is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:    bin/gpm install cookieconsentThis will install the Cookieconsent plugin into your `/user/plugins` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins/cookieconsent`.### Manual InstallationTo install this plugin, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then, rename the folder to `cookieconsent`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/naucon/grav-plugin-cookieconsent) or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins#extras).You should now have all the plugin files under    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/cookieconsent	> NOTE: This plugin is a modular component for Grav which requires [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) and the [Error](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-error) and [Problems](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-problems) to operate.## ConfigurationBefore configuring this plugin, you should copy the `user/plugins/cookieconsent/cookieconsent.yaml` to `user/config/plugins/cookieconsent.yaml` and only edit that copy.Here is the default configuration:```yamlenabled: true```## Advanced configurationYou can customize texts, shape and color with the following available options:```yaml# Include JavaScript and CSS files from official CDN or localcdn: true# Message on the banner (overwrite translation)content_message: 'This website uses cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website.'# Dismiss button text (overwrite translation)content_dismiss: 'Got it!'# Policy link text (overwrite translation)content_link: 'Learn more'# Link to policy (overwrite translation)content_href: 'https://cookiesandyou.com'# Color of banner backgroundpopup_background_color: '#000'# Color of banner textpopup_text_color: '#fff'# Color of button backgroundbutton_background_color: '#f1d600'# Color of button textbutton_text_color: '#000'# Color of button borderbutton_border_color: '#f1d600'# Position on the website, where the banner will be displayed.# top = Top# top-pushdown: Top (Pushdown)# bottom: Bottom# bottom-left: Bottom Left# bottom-right: Bottom Rightposition: bottom# Button layout# block: Block (angled corners)# classic: Classic (round corners)# edgeless: Edgelesstheme: block# Type of Cookie Compliance, see https://cookieconsent.osano.com/documentation/compliance/# info: Informational, just tell users that we use cookies, only dismiss button# opt-in: Let users deny or allow cookies (Advanced, callback needed), buttons: deny, allowcompliance_type: 'info'```## Disabling cookiesWith compliance type "opt-in" you will need to provide a function to disable or enable cookies on your site.  Disabling cookies should be done with the callback hook. See https://cookieconsent.osano.com/documentation/disabling-cookies/  With compliance type "opt-in" additionally a small revoke button is shown for the user to change cookie settings.You can customize texts and define callback functions for cookie control with the following options:```yaml# Allow button text (overwrite translation)content_allow: 'Allow Cookies' # only for compliance type opt-in# Deny button text (overwrite translation)content_deny: 'Deny Cookies'   # only for compliance type opt-in# Change/Revoke Consent button text (overwrite translation)content_revoke: 'Change Cookie Consent'  # only for compliance type opt-in# Callback function to disable or enable cookies on your site. Example to only log a status change: callback_onStatusChange: "function(status) {  console.log(this.hasConsented() ? 'enable cookies': 'disable cookies');}"```The callback function to enable/disable tracking using the Google Analytics Plugin https://github.com/escopecz/grav-ganalytics Version 1.5 (coming soon) is:```yamlfunction(status) {  setGaTracking(this.hasConsented());}``` See also https://cookieconsent.osano.com/documentation/about-cookie-consent/, but only a subset of these functions are available here.### TranslationTranslations are defined in the `languages.yaml` file.Translations will be used if no `content_message`, `content_dismiss`, `content_link`, `content_href`, `content_allow`, `content_deny` or `content_revoke` are defined in `cookieconsent.yaml`.### Known Issues#### Incompatible themesThe plugin hooks into the grav asset manager (https://learn.getgrav.org/themes/asset-manager). Some themes haven't (properbly) integrated the assets manager and therefore do not work.Have a look at the following required elements in the base theme. Without them the plugin will not work.    {{ assets.css() }}    {{ assets.js() }}## LicenseThe MIT License (MIT)Copyright (c) 2015 Sven SanzenbacherPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

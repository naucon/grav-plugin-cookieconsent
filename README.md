# Cookie Consent Plugin

![Cookie Consent](assets/readme_1.png)

The **Cookie Consent** Plugin is for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav). This grav plugin is to alert users about the use of cookies on your website. The plugin integrates the popular js lib [cookie consent](https://github.com/insites/cookieconsent/) by insites.

## Installation

Installing the Cookieconsent plugin can be done in one of two ways. The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the plugin with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file.

### GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this plugin is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install cookieconsent

This will install the Cookieconsent plugin into your `/user/plugins` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins/cookieconsent`.

### Manual Installation

To install this plugin, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then, rename the folder to `cookieconsent`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/naucon/grav-plugin-cookieconsent) or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins#extras).

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/cookieconsent
	
> NOTE: This plugin is a modular component for Grav which requires [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) and the [Error](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-error) and [Problems](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-problems) to operate.

## Configuration

Before configuring this plugin, you should copy the `user/plugins/cookieconsent/cookieconsent.yaml` to `user/config/plugins/cookieconsent.yaml` and only edit that copy.

Here is the default configuration:

```yaml
enabled: true
```

## Advanced configuration

You can customize texts, shape and color with the following available options:

```yaml
# Message on the banner (overwrite translation)
content_message: 'This website uses cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website.'
# Dismiss button text (overwrite translation)
content_dismiss: 'Got it!'
# Policy link text (overwrite translation)
content_link: 'Learn more'
# Link to policy (overwrite translation)
content_href: 'https://cookiesandyou.com'

# Color of banner background

# Color of buttton background
button_background_color: '#f1d600'
# Color of button text
button_text_color: '#000'
# Color of button border
button_border_color: '#f1d600'

# Position on the website, where the banner will be displayed.
# top = Top
# top-pushdown: Top (Pushdown)
# bottom: Bottom
# bottom-left: Bottom Left
# bottom-right: Bottom Right
position: bottom

# Button layout
# block: Block (angled corners)

```

### Translation

Translations are defined in the `languages.yaml` file.

Translations will be used if no `content_message`, `content_dismiss`, `content_link` or `content_href` are defined in `cookieconsent.yaml`.

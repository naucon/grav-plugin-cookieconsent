:warning: Unless you are also annoyed :rage4:  
by the fact of [CookieConsent](https://cookieconsent.insites.com/download/) don't offer the [last version of their JS](https://github.com/insites/cookieconsent/blob/master/src/cookieconsent.js) which result of not using [**noopener noreferrer nofollow**](https://github.com/insites/cookieconsent/blob/master/src/cookieconsent.js#L225) which impacts [performance and security](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/noopener).

You should use the original GravCMS Plugin [cookie consent](https://github.com/naucon/grav-plugin-cookieconsent) by naucon.

## NOTE:
- This repo will be destroyed as soon insites compile the JS with **noopener noreferrer nofollow** included.
- Neither me nor naucon are affiliated with [cookie consent](https://github.com/insites/cookieconsent/) and/or insites.
